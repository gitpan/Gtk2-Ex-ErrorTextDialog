---------------------------------------------------------------------

This is only really a place-holder for possible future translations of
the few messages in the ErrorTextDialog.

Currently there's nothing translated, and the messages probably aren't
settled enough to want to put work into translation.

"charset=UTF-8" should be used in all the .po files because that's
what ErrorTextDialog.pm asks for, to be Perl wide-char strings
internally.  A charset other than utf-8 still works, it just means
gettext must convert at runtime.  The .pot file, incidentally, is all
ASCII.

header.pot is the start part of Gtk2-Ex-ErrorTextDialog.pot, put there
by the generate/update rules in Makefile.PL.  gettext does a
particularly poor job preserving or generating a .pot header.
